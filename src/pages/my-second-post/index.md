Everything? Nothing? or something? I have been listening to some great global leaders who have came across many things which are Not “Right with our Education System.” First of all I want to make clear that I am not a STUDY HATER, I love to study but I have something about our education system to share which is for an average student.

const harsh = "baby"
console.log(`Harsh kaun h? Harsh ${harsh} hai!`)
const reality = function() {

  console.log(`this is an arrow function`)

## School Makes us Less Intelligent

It may sound funny but it is a profound truth, can you guess how many criteria may be there for intelligence? maybe you can guess 2 or 3, from Wikipedia I found that there are a Total of 8 CRITERIA for judging someone’s intelligence and they are as follows —

1. [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)
2. [Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding)
3. [Self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness)
4. [Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning)
5. [Emotional Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_knowledge)
6. [Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan)
7. [Creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity)
8. [Problem Solving.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving)

Now here’s my question, how many of these you remember learning in school? maybe 3? and that too schools are not able to teach properly and how many students can learn these skills on there own in a class on average, maybe 7 or at most 15 if the class has like 40 students like an average class.

Now you are a student at grade 9 and have been just never taught anything except academic things, you only have academic intelligence, rest of your qualities have deteriorated from your childhood, maybe you became intelligent in 2 criteria, and deteriorated in the rest 6, would you call this becoming more intelligent? Yes, you are just academically intelligent at the point.

There are tons of content on YouTube blaming our Education System but this [Ted-Talk by Eddy Zhong](https://youtu.be/2Yt6raj-S1M) is what I have specifically focused under this heading, be sure to watch it.

## But Anyways We 5th Standard Passed Students can Brag about Ourselves being Educated.

So you are a cocky person thinking that I will brag about myself being educated and get jobs, but for sure I can tell you that in India some uneducated child-laborers are even more intelligent than a 8th Standard passed student in many aspects, the child-laborer has a better behavior, knows how politics work both internally and externally, and this 8th Standard passed kid just passed by rote learning of civics not understanding anything.

**But.. But I understood every concept of civics, how come he be more intelligent than me? I can still brag around.**
Civics and politics is just one aspect you can even fill a bank account form properly, do anything in society properly, you are a modern weak kid but that uneducated child-laborer can even fill a mortgage form with just passing the 2nd standard.

**What Happens when you Learn ‘What To’ in School but not ‘How To’**
Another major problem that I get in school is that they don’t tell us ‘How To Learn’ at least design book the way that it get easy to learn, consult a learning expert before publishing a book or teach us the techniques which helps the student learn fast. I was experiencing problem in rote learning in History, uh.. those years, what if they told techniques with which I could remember the radicals in chemistry, tables in math and years in history easily? You might thing it is genetic, no it is not, I also used to think that in past till I came across a guy named Jonathan Levi who is a super learner, he has a great course on how to become a Super Learner, so what I was supposed to learn in school now I need to pay for it separately. But to be honest the course is worth it.

[Here is a video of Jonathan Levi discussing about ‘What if school taught us how to learn’.](https://youtu.be/vtQzuwnyW6E)

## Teaching for Mastery

Education gap is another major problem with this education system, students can easily be passed in this system without knowing everything in a subject which gradually develops education gaps, when these students are learning subjects in higher class they don’t understand things because they don’t know the things from previous classes, the resultant is that the student gets even more bored and show dis-indulgence in studies and the student’s performance starts deteriorating till the student completely falls apart.
This problem was presented by [Sal Khan of Khan Academy on his Ted Talk ‘Let’s teach for mastery’](https://youtu.be/-MTRxRO5SRA) and I quite agree with it.

## So What’s the Solution

If you followed with my article and watched all the videos Sal Khan presented the solution to his problem, just use computers to teach for mastery which is possible today, computers can easily track progress and with artificial intelligence we can make everything even more interactive and understanding.
For the problems that I mentioned earlier, the solution is simple, teach everyone every intelligence criteria equally so their equilibrium increases rather than decreasing.

I’d like to continue this article but this is my first, this article may get edited when I get enough support and get many more heading, just because of the fact this is my first I don’t think this is going to attract much people.
